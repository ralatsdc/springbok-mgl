(ii) is, or has been: (A) committed to a hospital or institution for mental illness, alcohol or substance abuse, except a commitment pursuant to sections 35 or 36C of chapter 123, unless after 5 years from the date of the confinement the applicant submits with the application an affidavit of a licensed physician or clinical psychologist attesting familiarity with the applicant’s mental illness, alcohol or substance abuse and that in the physician’s or psychologist’s opinion, the applicant is not suffering from a mental illness, or alcohol or substance abuse in a manner that shall prevent the applicant from possessing a licensed firearm or permitted long gun; (B) committed by a court order to a hospital or institution for mental illness, unless the applicant was granted a petition for relief of the court order pursuant to said section 36C of said chapter 123 and submits a copy of the court order with the application; (C) subject to an order of the probate court appointing a guardian or conservator for an incapacitated person on the grounds that the applicant lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage the applicant’s affairs, unless the applicant was granted a petition for relief of the order of the probate court pursuant to section 56C of chapter 215 and submits a copy of the order with the application; or (D) found to be a person with an alcohol use disorder or substance use disorder or both and committed pursuant to said section 35 of said chapter 123, unless the applicant was granted a petition for relief of the court order pursuant to said section 35 and submits a copy of the court order with the application;

Upon filing, a copy of the written petition and statement will be provided to the applicant by the licensing authority. The court shall within 90 days of receiving the filed petition hold a hearing to determine if the applicant for the long gun permit is unsuitable and enter a judgment on suitability.

If a court enters a judgment that an applicant is unsuitable the court shall notify the applicant in writing setting forth the specific reasons for such determination. If a court has not entered a judgement that an applicant is unsuitable within 90 days of the petition, judgment that the applicant is suitable for a long gun license shall be automatically entered.

(c) The petitioner shall provide to the board a copy of a completed long gun permit, self-defense spray permit or license to carry application, which application shall have previously been submitted to the licensing authority or be submitted to the licensing authority contemporaneously with the petition filed with the board. The petitioner shall have the burden to prove his suitability to receive a long gun permit, self-defense spray permit or a license to carry by clear and convincing evidence. The board shall set a reasonable filing fee to file the petition.

If requested by the petitioner and payment for stenographic services, as determined by the board, accompanies such request, the board shall cause a verbatim transcript of the hearing to be made. The board's decisions and findings of facts therefore shall be communicated in writing to the petitioner and to the licensing authority to whom the petitioner has applied or intends to apply within 20 days of rendering a decision.

Any confiscated firearm shall be considered surrendered and subject to the conditions of section 123D; provided, however, that the confiscated firearm shall be returned to the owner if proof of license or permit reinstatement is provided within 1 year of confiscation. This paragraph shall not apply to temporary licenses to carry under section 124B.  
Section 123C. (a) A licensing authority shall revoke or suspend any license or permit issued in sections 124 to 125B, inclusive, upon the occurrence of any event which makes the licensee or permit holder a prohibited person as defined in section 123. A licensing authority may also revoke or suspend any license or permit issued in sections 124 to 125B, inclusive, upon a subsequent determination of unsuitability as defined in section 123, or upon satisfactory proof that the licensee has violated or permitted any violation of this chapter; provided, however, that a licensing authority shall not revoke a long gun permit on the grounds of unsuitability and shall instead petition the district court for revocation pursuant to the procedures of subsection (c) of section 123. A licensing authority may revoke or suspend any license issued under sections 125 or 125B only after due notice to the licensee and reasonable opportunity to be heard.
(b) Any revocation or suspension of a license or permit shall be in writing and shall state the reasons therefor. No pendency of proceedings before the court shall operate to stay such revocation or suspension. Notices of revocation and suspension shall be forwarded to the commissioner of the department of criminal justice information services and the commissioner of probation and shall be included in the criminal justice information system. A revoked or suspended license or permit may be reinstated only upon the termination of all disqualifying conditions.

(c) Any applicant or licensee aggrieved by a denial, revocation, or suspension of a license to sell under section 125 may within 10 days thereafter apply to the colonel of the state police for such license, who may direct that said licensing authority grant said license, if, after a hearing, the colonel is satisfied that there were no reasonable grounds for the denial, suspension or revocation and that the applicant is not barred by law from holding such a license. 
(d) Any applicant, licensee or permit holder aggrieved by a denial, revocation or suspension of a license or permit issued under sections 124 to 125B, inclusive, may, unless a hearing has previously been held pursuant to chapter 209A, within either 90 days after receiving notice of the denial, revocation or suspension or within 90 days after the expiration of the time limit during which the licensing authority shall respond to the applicant, file a petition to obtain judicial review in the district court having jurisdiction in the city or town in which the applicant filed the application or in which the license or permit was issued.

The person or the person's legal representative shall have the right, at any time up to 1 year after the delivery or surrender, to transfer the firearms and ammunition, notwithstanding the limits on private firearm transfers in section 127B, to a licensed dealer or to a person legally permitted to purchase or take possession of the firearms and ammunition and, upon notification in writing by the purchaser or transferee and the former owner, the licensing authority shall within 10 days deliver the firearms and ammunition to the transferee or purchaser and the licensing authority shall observe due care in the receipt and holding of any such firearm or ammunition; provided, however, that the purchaser or transferee shall affirm in writing that the purchaser or transferee shall not transfer the firearms or ammunition to the former owner; provided further, however, that such transfer will not be permitted if the firearm may be evidence in any pending criminal investigation. The licensing authority shall at the time of delivery or surrender inform the person in writing of their right to request a transfer in accordance with this paragraph.
(b) The licensing authority, after taking possession of any firearm or ammunition by any means, may transfer possession for storage purposes to a federally licensed firearms dealer who operates a bonded warehouse on the licensed premises that is equipped with a safe for the secure storage of firearms and a weapon box or similar container for the secure storage of ammunition; provided, however, that the licensing authority shall not transfer to such dealer possession of any firearm, or ammunition that may be evidence in any pending criminal investigation. Any such dealer that takes possession of a firearm or ammunition pursuant to this section shall: (i) inspect the firearm or ammunition; (ii) issue to the owner a receipt indicating the make, model, caliber, serial number and condition of each firearm or ammunition so received; and (iii) store and maintain all firearms and ammunition so received in accordance with such regulations, rules or guidelines as the secretary of the executive office of public safety may establish under this section.

(e) Unless otherwise required in this chapter, if the licensing authority cannot reasonably ascertain a lawful owner within 180 days of acquisition by the authority, the authority may, in its discretion, trade or dispose of surplus, donated, abandoned or junk firearms or ammunition to properly licensed distributors or firearms dealers. The proceeds of the sale or transfer shall be remitted or credited to the municipality in which the authority presides to purchase weapons, equipment or supplies or for violence reduction or suicide prevention; provided, however, that no firearm or ammunition identified pursuant to section 122C as having been used to carry out a criminal act shall be considered surplus, donated, abandoned or junk for the purposes of this section.
(f) The licensing authority shall report the delivery or surrender, or seizure of firearms and ammunition pursuant to sections 131 to 131H, inclusive, to the department of criminal justice information services via the electronic firearms registration system.  The report shall include the following information: (i) date of delivery, surrender or seizure; (ii) make, model, serial number and caliber of the firearm delivered, surrendered or seized and any identifying information for ammunition delivered, surrendered or seized; (iii) grounds for surrender or seizure; (iv) whether the firearm, or ammunition is prohibited by law from being owned or possessed in the commonwealth; (v) whether the firearm, or ammunition was classified as having been used to carry out a criminal act; (vi) information on the possession, storage, transfer, sale and any income derived therefrom and (vii) the destruction, or other disposition of the firearm or ammunition.

This license is subject to the same terms, conditions and qualifications of a license to sell issued under section 125. 
(b) The colonel of the state police may, after an investigation, grant a license to a club or facility with an on-site shooting range or gallery, which club is incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth a club license for the possession, storage and use of large capacity firearms and ammunition therefor for use on the premises of the club; provided, however that not less than 1 shareholder of the club shall be qualified and suitable to be issued a license; and provided further, that such large capacity firearms and feeding devices may be used under the club license only by a member that possesses a valid license to carry firearms issued pursuant to section 124, or by such other person that the club permits while under the direct supervision of a certified firearms safety instructor or club member who possesses a valid license to carry firearms.

Section 125C. (a) No licensee under section 125 may sell, rent, lease or otherwise transfer any firearm described in this section except to a business entity that is primarily a firearm wholesaler, and such transfer must, by its terms, prohibit the purchaser from reselling such firearm to a firearm retailer or consumer in the commonwealth. This section shall apply to: 
(i) A firearm that has a frame, barrel, cylinder, slide or breechblock that is composed of (A) any metal having a melting point of less than 900 degrees Fahrenheit; (B) any metal having an ultimate tensile strength of less than 55,000 pounds per square inch; or (C) any powdered metal having a density of less than 7.5 grams per cubic centimeter. This clause shall not apply to any make and model of a firearm for which a sample of 3 firearms in new condition all pass the following test: each of the 3 samples shall fire 600 rounds, stopping every 100 rounds to tighten any loose screws and to clean the gun if required by the cleaning schedule in the user manual, and as needed to refill the empty magazine or cylinder to capacity before continuing. For any firearm that is loaded in a manner other than via a detachable magazine, the tester shall also pause every 50 rounds for ten minutes. The ammunition used shall be the type recommended by the firearm manufacturer in its user manual or, if none is recommended, any standard of ammunition of the correct caliber in new condition. A firearm shall pass this test if it fires the first 20 rounds without a malfunction, fires the full 600 rounds with not more than 6 malfunctions and completes the test without any crack or breakage of an operating part of the firearm that does not increase the danger of injury to the user. For purposes of this clause “malfunction” shall mean any failure to feed, chamber, fire, extract or eject a round or any failure to accept or eject a magazine or any other failure which prevents the firearm, without manual intervention beyond that needed for routine firing and periodic reloading, from firing the chambered round or moving a new round into position so that the firearm is capable of firing the new round properly. This shall not include a misfire caused by a faulty cartridge the primer of which fails to detonate when properly struck by the firearm’s firing mechanism;  
(ii) A firearm that is prone to accidental discharge which, for purposes of this clause, shall mean any make and model of firearm for which a sample of 5 firearms in new condition all undergo, and none discharge during, the following test: each of the 5 sample firearms shall be: (A) test loaded; (B) set so that the firearm is in a condition such that pulling the trigger and taking any action that must simultaneously accompany the pulling of the trigger as part of the firing procedure would fire the firearm; and (C) dropped onto a solid slab of concrete from a height of one meter from each of the following positions: (1) normal firing position; (2) upside down; (3) on grip; (4) on the muzzle; (5) on either side; and (6) on the exposed hammer or striker or, if there is no exposed hammer or striker, the rearmost part of the firearm. If the firearm is designed so that its hammer or striker may be set in other positions, each sample firearm shall be tested as above with the hammer or striker in each such position but otherwise in such condition that pulling the trigger, and taking any action that must simultaneously accompany the pulling of the trigger as part of the firing procedure, would fire the firearm. Alternatively, the tester may use additional sample firearms of the same make and model, in a similar condition, for the test of each of these hammer striker settings. 
(iii) A firearm that is prone to (A) firing more than once per pull of trigger; or (B) explosion during firing. 
(iv) The firearm has a barrel less than 3 inches in length, unless the licensee discloses in writing, prior to the transaction, to the prospective buyer, lessee or transferee the limitations of the accuracy of the particular make and model of the subject firearm, by disclosing the make and model’s average group diameter test result at 7 yards, average group diameter test result at 14 yards and average group diameter test result at 21 yards. For purpose of this clause, “average group diameter test result” shall mean the arithmetic mean of three separate trials, each performed as follows on a different sample firearm in new condition of the make and model at issue. Each firearm shall fire 5 rounds at a target from a set distance and the largest spread in inches between the centers of any of the holes made in the test target shall be measured and recorded. This procedure shall be repeated 2 more times on the firearm. The arithmetic mean of each of the 3 recorded results shall be deemed the result of the trial for that particular sample firearm. The ammunition used shall be the type recommended by the firearm manufacturer in its user manual, if none is recommended, any standard ammunition of the correct caliber in new condition. 
(b) This section shall not apply to (i) a firearm lawfully owned or possessed under a license issued under this chapter on or before October 21, 1998; (ii) a stun gun; or (iii) a firearm designated by the secretary of public safety, with the advice of the firearm control advisory board, established pursuant to section 128, as a firearm solely designed and sold for formal target shooting competition or for Olympic shooting competition and listed on the rosters therefor pursuant to section 128A.

Section 131A. (a) The court shall, within 10 days of receipt of a petition pursuant to section 131, conduct a hearing on the petition. Upon receipt of the petition, the court shall issue a summons with the date, time and location of the hearing. The court shall direct a law enforcement officer to personally serve a copy of the petition and the summons on the respondent or, if personal service by a law enforcement officer is not possible, the court may, after a hearing, order that service be made by some other identified means reasonably calculated to reach the respondent. Service shall be made not less than 7 days prior to the hearing.
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), the court shall, within 2 days of receipt of a petition made pursuant to section 131, conduct a hearing on the petition if the respondent files an affidavit that a firearm or ammunition is required in the performance of the respondent's employment.
(c)(1) If after the hearing pursuant to subsection (a) or subsection (b), the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent poses a risk of causing bodily injury to self or others by having in the respondent's control, ownership or possession a firearm or ammunition, the court shall grant the petition. If the respondent does not appear at the hearing pursuant to subsection (a) or subsection (b), the court shall grant the petition upon a determination that the petitioner has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent poses such a risk.
(2) Upon granting a petition, the court shall issue an extreme risk protection order and shall order the respondent to surrender any firearms licenses and permits and all firearms and ammunition which the respondent then controls, owns or possesses to the licensing authority of the municipality where the respondent resides. The court shall enter written findings as to the basis of its order within 24 hours of granting the order. The court may modify, suspend or terminate its order at any subsequent time upon motion by either party; provided, however, that due notice shall be given to the respondent and petitioner, and the court shall hold a hearing on said motion. When the petitioner's address is confidential to the respondent as provided in subsection (d) of section 131 and the respondent has filed a motion to modify the court's order, the court shall be responsible for notifying the petitioner.

(3) Not less than 30 calendar days prior to the expiration of an extreme risk protection order, the court shall notify the petitioner at the best-known address of the scheduled expiration of the order and that the petitioner may file a petition to renew the order pursuant to section 131.
(d)(1) If after the hearing pursuant to subsection (a) or subsection (b), the court has probable cause to believe that the respondent has access to a firearm or ammunition, on their person or in an identified place, and the respondent fails to surrender any firearms within 24 hours, the court shall issue a warrant identifying the property, naming or describing the person or place to be searched, and  commanding the appropriate law enforcement agency to search the person of the respondent and any identified place and seize any firearm or ammunition found to which the respondent would have access.

(3) Upon execution of the extreme risk protection order warrant, the law enforcement agency conducting the search shall issue a receipt identifying any firearm or ammunition seized. The law enforcement agency shall provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. The licensing authority shall then, within 48 hours of the search, return the warrant to the court with the original receipt. If the law enforcement agency executing the warrant and the licensing authority for the municipality where the respondent resides are different, the law enforcement agency shall remit to the licensing authority a copy of the receipt along with any seized items, and shall file with its warrant and receipt a certification signed by both the law enforcement agency and the licensing authority that the seized items were delivered to and accepted by the licensing authority. The licensing authority shall store the seized items with any items surrendered in accordance with subsection (f).
(e) Upon issuing an extreme risk protection order the clerk-magistrate of the court shall transmit 2 certified copies of the order and 1 copy of the petition and summons forthwith to the licensing authority of the municipality where the respondent resides which, unless otherwise ordered by the court, shall serve a copy of the order and petition upon the respondent.

The licensing authority shall, within 48 hours of the surrender or 48 hours of receipt after seizure, file the receipt with the court.
(h) If a person other than the respondent claims title to any firearms or ammunition required to be surrendered, or seized pursuant to this section, and is determined by the licensing authority to be the lawful owner of the firearms or ammunition, the firearms, feeding devices or ammunition shall be returned to the person; provided, however, that: (i) the firearms or ammunition are removed from the respondent's control, ownership or possession and the lawful owner agrees to store the firearms or ammunition in a manner such that the respondent does not have access to, or control of, the firearms or ammunition; and (ii) the firearms or ammunition are not otherwise unlawfully possessed by the owner. A violation of this subsection shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $5,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 2 1/2 years in a house of correction or by both such fine and imprisonment.
(i) Upon the expiration or termination of an extreme risk protection order, a licensing authority holding any firearms or ammunition that have been surrendered or seized pursuant to this section shall return any firearms license or permit and all firearms or ammunition requested by a respondent only after the licensing authority of the municipality in which the respondent resides confirms that the respondent is suitable for a firearms license or permit and to control, own or possess firearms or ammunition under federal and state law.
Not less than 7 days prior to the expiration of an extreme risk protection order, a licensing authority holding any firearms or ammunition that have been surrendered pursuant to this section shall notify the petitioner of the expiration of the extreme risk protection order and the return of a firearms license or permit and the return of any firearms or ammunition to the respondent.
As soon as reasonably practicable after receiving notice of the termination of an extreme risk protection order by the court, a licensing authority holding any firearms or ammunition that have been surrendered pursuant to this section shall notify the petitioner of the termination of the extreme risk protection order and the return of a firearms license or permit and the return of any firearms or ammunition to the respondent.
(j) A respondent who has surrendered a firearms license or permit and all firearms or ammunition to a licensing authority, or who had any firearms or ammunition seized by a law enforcement agency,  and who does not wish to have the firearms license or permit or firearms or ammunition returned or who is no longer eligible to control, own or possess firearms or ammunition pursuant to this chapter or federal law, may sell or transfer title of the firearms or ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer, notwithstanding the limits on private firearm transfers in section 127B; provided, however, that the respondent shall not take physical possession of the firearms or ammunition. The licensing authority may transfer possession of the firearms or ammunition to a licensed dealer upon the dealer providing the licensing authority with written proof of the sale or transfer of title of the firearms or ammunition from the respondent to the dealer.
(k) If the licensing authority cannot reasonably ascertain the lawful owner of any firearms or ammunition surrendered or seized pursuant to this section within 180 days of the expiration or termination of the order to surrender the firearms or ammunition the licensing authority may dispose of the firearms or ammunition pursuant to section 123D.
